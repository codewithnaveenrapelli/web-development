## CSS Syntax

CSS follows a rule-based structure. Each rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. Selectors pick the HTML elements, while declaration blocks contain pairs of properties and values.

Syntax:
```html
selector{
    property:value;
}
```

Note: Semi-colon (;) at the end of each new property and property value is IMPORTANT.

Example:

```html
h2{
    color: blue;
}
```

* h2: h2 is the selector.
* color: It's the property.
* blue: The property value.

* Within the declaration block, there can be multiple pairs of properties and values.

```html
button{
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
    border: transparent;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

* Here, 'button' is the selector, and there are multiple pairs of properties and values. Each pair is separated by a semicolon ";".
