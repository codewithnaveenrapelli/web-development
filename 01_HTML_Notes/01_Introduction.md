## Why the Term Hyper Text & Markup Language?
* The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: **'hypertext'** and **'markup language'** 
    - **'Hypertext'** refers to the linking of text with other documents.
    - **'markup language'** denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.
* HTML is the practice of linking text with other documents through the use of particular tags.
* **Note:** Tags are meaningful texts enclosed in angle braces, like **'<...>'**. For example, the ```'<head>'``` tag. Each tag has a unique meaning and significance in building an HTML page, and it can influence the web page in various ways.
