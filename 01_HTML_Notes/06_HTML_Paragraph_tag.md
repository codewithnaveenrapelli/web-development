## HTML Paragraphs

In HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```
## HTML Horizontal Rules

The ```<hr>``` element is used to separate content in an HTML page.

hr tag is empty tag which mean that it has no end tag

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```
## HTML Line Breaks

In HTML ```<br>``` element defines a line break.

```<br>``` if you want a line break without starting a new paragraph.

```html
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
```
